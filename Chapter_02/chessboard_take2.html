This is the chess board example from Eloquent JS Chapter 2 exercises. This is my crack at the code after rereading chapter 2. See the results in the dev tools.

// Chess board example from Eloquent JS Chapter 2 exercises

var grid = "";
size = 20;

for (var a = 0; a < size ; a++) {
	
		for (var b = 0; b < size ; b++) {
			
			if (a % 2 != 0) { 			
				if (b % 2 == 0) grid = grid + "#";
				else grid = grid + " ";
			} else 
				if (b % 2 == 0) grid = grid + " ";
				else grid = grid + "#";
			
		}	
		
		grid = grid + "\n";
	
}

console.log(grid);



/* this was the code I used the first time trough this exercise. 
upon further review I don't believe this is correct. the 2nd try code is similar but correct.
this prints out one line at a time where v2 prints out one string across multiple lines, using line breaks, per the instructions in the exercise


var board = "";
size = 20;

for (var rows = 0; rows <= size; rows += 1) {
    board = "";
    for (var columns = 0; columns <= size; columns += 1) {
        if (rows % 2 != 0) 
            if (columns % 2 != 0) 
                board = "#" + board;
            else
                board = " " + board;
        else 
            if (columns % 2 != 0) 
                board = " " + board;
            else
                board = "#" + board;
    }        
    console.log(board);
